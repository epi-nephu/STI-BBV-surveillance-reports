## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), "PHAR")

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, connection="con")

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(DBI)
```

```{r extract_data}
sti_raw <- dbGetQuery(con, 
"
SELECT * FROM dh_public_health.phess_release.caseevents 
WHERE CONDITION_TYPE = 'Sexually Transmissible Infections' 
AND EVENT_DATE BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2024-04-30' 
ORDER BY EVENT_DATE DESC; 
"
)
```


```{sql, output.var="gono1"}
SELECT ce.*, ex.*
FROM dh_public_health.phess_release.caseevents ce
LEFT JOIN dh_public_health.phess_release.caseexposures ex ON ce.EVENT_ID = ex.EVENT_ID
WHERE ce.CONDITION = "Gonococcal infection"
AND ce.EVENT_DATE BETWEEN "2024-01-01" AND "2024-04-30"
ORDER BY ce.EVENT_DATE DESC;

```
